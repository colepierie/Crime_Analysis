## Neighborhood analysis

We seperated the Neighborhoods into the top 20 with the most crime reported and the bottom 20 with the least crime reported. 

Though the two groups have very large differences in the amount of reported crime, both have similar distributions of severe vs non-severe crimes reported, with the lower crime reported neighbors actually having a slightly higher percentage of severe crimes being reported. 

Surprisingly, it appears that the number of crimes reported has been decreasing in the first group as opposed to the second. It is interesting that they both follow the same general shape though, with local lows in 2009 and 2014. 

Crime reporting should be evaluated by population density, as this is likely impacting our analysis, especially in regards to the neighborhood behavior.
Our findings are inconclusive since we do not have population data to compare the crime reports per capita. 

## Crime Reporting Trends over the years

We can see that crime reports are generally decreasing which coincides with reports of total crime reports in the USA. With severe crimes seem to be the biggest driver in the drop in overall crimes reported. The number of arrests for drug related crimes has overall dropped since 2008, however heroin has seen a slight increase in arrests. However, we also saw that homicide rates have begun increasing in St. Louis, begging the question: if total crime is decreasing why is homicide reporting increasing in St. Louis?
